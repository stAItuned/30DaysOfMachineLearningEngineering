## Day 0 - What is this challenge about?

After completing the #66DaysOfDataChallenge, we decided to tackle a new challenge, namely the **#30DaysOfMachineLearningEngineering** challenge! 

During the last two years I learned a lot about theoretical concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and several other related disciplines. However, I recognize that I still need to learn and to work on some of the “**best practices**” in the field. 

After some research, I found the great book “**Machine Learning Engineering**” by [Andriy Burkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/), and after I’ve read the foreword by [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/), I was convinced that it was the right one. 

Therefore, for the following **30 days**, I will share daily bites from the book and I would love to open some debates on the relative topics! 

I will also convey all the daily posts in this **GitHub repository** and our **blog**!

P.S. I do truly believe on the values of this challenge, and great examples can be given by [Boris Giba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borisgiba/) and [Tinham Tamang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinam-tamang/), just to name a few. 

Disclaimer: The book is distributed on the “read first, buy later” principle. Therefore you can  freely read the book too and then decide to buy it!

## Day 01 - Machine Learning preliminaries

Today we went through the first chapter of the “Machine Learning Engineering” book by Andriy Burkov. 

This chapter starts from the **initial definitions** of Machine Learning, Supervised vs Unsupervised learning, as in any ML book. 

However, there are two interesting sections devoted to “when to use” and “when to not use” Machine Learning. 

Ideally, Machine Learning **should be employed** when the problem cannot be hard-coded, when we expect a lot of variations over time, when it involves a perceptive problem, when there is little information about the topic, when it has a simple objective and finally, when it is cost effective! 

On the other hand, Machine Learning **should be avoided** when every action or behavior has to be explained, when the error cost it too high, when the data is too expansive or hard to obtain, when the problem is too complex and it has too many required outcomes and when it can be eventually solved through heuristics or lookup tables.
