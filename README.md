## Day 0 - What is this challenge about?

After completing the #66DaysOfDataChallenge, we decided to tackle a new challenge, namely the **#30DaysOfMachineLearningEngineering** challenge! 

During the last two years I learned a lot about theoretical concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and several other related disciplines. However, I recognize that I still need to learn and to work on some of the “**best practices**” in the field. 

After some research, I found the great book “**Machine Learning Engineering**” by [Andriy Burkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/), and after I’ve read the foreword by [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/), I was convinced that it was the right one. 

Therefore, for the following **30 days**, I will share daily bites from the book and I would love to open some debates on the relative topics! 

I will also convey all the daily posts in this **GitHub repository** and our **blog**!

P.S. I do truly believe on the values of this challenge, and great examples can be given by [Boris Giba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borisgiba/) and [Tinham Tamang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thinam-tamang/), just to name a few. 

Disclaimer: The book is distributed on the “read first, buy later” principle. Therefore you can  freely read the book too and then decide to buy it!

## Day 01 - Machine Learning preliminaries

Today we went through the first chapter of the “Machine Learning Engineering” book by Andriy Burkov. 

This chapter starts from the **initial definitions** of Machine Learning, Supervised vs Unsupervised learning, as in any ML book. 

However, there are two interesting sections devoted to “when to use” and “when to not use” Machine Learning. 

Ideally, Machine Learning **should be employed** when the problem cannot be hard-coded, when we expect a lot of variations over time, when it involves a perceptive problem, when there is little information about the topic, when it has a simple objective and finally, when it is cost effective! 

On the other hand, Machine Learning **should be avoided** when every action or behavior has to be explained, when the error cost it too high, when the data is too expansive or hard to obtain, when the problem is too complex and it has too many required outcomes and when it can be eventually solved through heuristics or lookup tables.

## Day 02 - Impact of a Machine Learning project

Today we went through the second chapter of the “Machine Learning Engineering” book by Andriy Burkov. 

It covers the **preliminary stage of any ML project**. The key aspect of any project is the prioritization, based on estimated impact and costs. 

The **impact** can be measured on what it can replace from the broader engineering project and from the provided benefits of the predictions. Do they save time? Money? 

Here is reported the potential value of **inexpensive predictions**. If we are able to develop a model which predicts a large number of observations at nearly-zero cost, we would be able to automatize the process that before that, was probably done by hand. 

However, the mistakes have to be taken into account. There is always a trade-off to bear in mind. How many mistakes does it make on average? How much does a mistake cost to us?


## Day 03 - Cost of a Machine Learning project

Today we went through the second chapter of the “Machine Learning Engineering” book by Andriy Burkov. 

It covers the **preliminary stage of any ML project**. The key aspect of any project is the prioritization, based on estimated impact and costs. 

The **cost** of a ML project is mainly characterized by the **difficulty** of the problem, the cost of the **data** and the required level of **accuracy**.  The latter is probably the trickiest because the relationship between cost and performances follows a **superlinear growth** 

The **first milestone** regards the difficulty of the problem, starting from already available solutions (if any) and ending with the requested computation power required. The **second milestone** is the data. It is important to understand whether the data is available and how does it cost to build the infrastructure, to label and to maintain the data.

## Day 04 - Complexity of a Machine Learning project

Today we went through the second chapter of the “Machine Learning Engineering” book by Andriy Burkov. 

It covers the **preliminary stage of any ML project**. The key aspect of any project is the prioritization, based on estimated impact and costs.

Estimating the **complexity** of a ML project is everything but easy. To do so, the are different ways. 

- **Compare existing projects:** in can give an idea of the current state of the art
- **Compare human performances**: this can help in order to evaluate a human benchmark in terms of time and performances.
- **Benchmark on simpler scenarios**: try to simplify the problem and check whether if it is solvable. If so, you can start to make the model more complex in order to answer to broader requirements.
